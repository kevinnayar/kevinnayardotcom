## Hello there

I'm a **Software Engineer** and a proud father to an Australian Kelpie named Jpeg. Professionally, I've worn many hats such as **Engineer**, **Consultant**, **Manager**, and **Director**. At my last few gigs, I managed technical teams at companies like **Dropbox** and **Spredfast** (now known as **Khoros**). Currently, I'm a **Senior Software Engineer** working at a scaleup called **AllStripes**. We're building a platform to advance rare disease research.

I enjoy writing **Typescript** but also dabble in **Golang**. Outside of the 9 to 5, you can catch me hosting whiskey tasting events, going for a trail run, or spending some quality time with my wonderful wife and our beautiful daughter.
