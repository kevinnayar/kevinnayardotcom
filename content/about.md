## Hello there

I'm a **product-focused engineer** that works across the web development tech stack and a proud father to an Australian Kelpie mix named Jpeg.

In past lives, I've also worn many other hats such as **Technical Consultant/Architect**, **Engineering Manager/Director**. At my last few gigs, I managed technical teams at companies like **Dropbox** and **Spredfast** (now known as **Khoros**). Currently, I'm a **Senior Software Engineer** working at a scaleup called **AllStripes**. We're building a platform to advance rare disease research.

I enjoy writing **Typescript** but also dabble in **Golang**. Outside of the 9 to 5, you can catch me hosting whiskey tasting events, going for a trail run, or spending some quality time with my wonderful wife and our beautiful daughter.
