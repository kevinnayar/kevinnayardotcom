## Test 1

I'm a **product-focused engineer** that works across the web development tech stack as well as a proud father to an Australian Kelpie mix named Jpeg.

In past lives, I've worn many hats such as **Software Consultant**, **Developer Advocate**, **Engineering Manager** and **Director**. At my last few gigs, I managed technical teams at companies like **Dropbox** and **Spredfast** (now known as **Khoros**). Currently, I'm a **Lead Fullstack Software Engineer** at a startup called **Tryal Clinical**. We're building a platform to simplify clinical trials and ultimately, advance medicine.

I enjoy writing **Typescript** but also dabble in **Golang**. Outside of the 9 to 5, you can catch me hosting whiskey tasting events, going for a trail run, or spending some quality time with my wonderful wife and our beautiful daughter.
