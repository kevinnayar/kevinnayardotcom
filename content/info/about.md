## Hello there

I'm a **product-focused engineer** that enjoys building things for the web.

Over the years, I’ve worn many hats — software consulting, developer advocacy, engineering management/directorship. I’ve led technical teams at places like Dropbox and Spredfast (now Khoros), and right now, I’m a **Lead Fullstack Engineer** at a startup called **TRYAL Clinical**, where we’re building a platform to simplify clinical trials and push medicine forward.

I enjoy writing **Typescript** but also dabble in **Golang** and **Python**. Outside of work, you might find me hosting a whiskey tasting, hitting the trails for a run, or spending time with my wife and daughter.
