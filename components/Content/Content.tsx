      <p>
        I&apos;m a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> and a proud father to an{' '}
        Australian Kelpie named Jpeg. Professionally, I&apos;ve worn many hats such{' '}
        as <strong>Engineer</strong>, <strong>Consultant</strong>,{' '}
        <strong>Manager</strong>, and <strong>Director</strong>. At my{' '}
        last few gigs, I managed technical teams at companies like{' '}
        <strong>Dropbox</strong> and <strong>Spredfast</strong> (now known as{' '}
        <strong>Khoros</strong>). Currently, I&apos;m a Senior Software Engineer{' '}
        working at a scaleup called <strong>AllStripes</strong>. We&apos;re{' '}
        building a platform to advance rare disease research.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy writing <strong>Typescript</strong> but also dabble in{' '}
        <strong>Golang</strong>. Outside of the 9 to 5, you can catch me hosting{' '}
        whiskey tasting events, going for a trail run, or spending some quality{' '}
        time with my wonderful{' '}
        <span className="strike-through">girlfriend</span>{' '}
        <span className="strike-through">fianc√©</span> wife and our beautiful daughter.{' '}

      <p>
        From time to time, I consult on large-scale fullstack Typescript{' '}
        codebases, especially ones using <strong>Node.js</strong> and{' '}
        <strong>React</strong>. If you&apos;d like to work with me, give me a shout.
